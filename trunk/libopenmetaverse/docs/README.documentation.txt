The library documentation is generated using external tools which currently create:

* A HTML Website http://www.libsecondlife.org/docs/trunk
* A compiled HTML Help file http://www.libsecondlife.org/docs/trunk/OpenMetaverse.chm

These are generated by our automated build system nightly using the inline XML code documentation.

If you want to generate these documents locally you will need to do the following:

1) Download and install the following tools:
   The latest version of Microsoft's Sandcastle (currently the May 2008 release as of February 4, 2009) http://www.codeplex.com/Sandcastle
   Patch to fix issues with the Sandcastle Themes: http://sandcastlestyles.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=18784#DownloadId=48243
   Sandcastle Help File Builder: http://www.codeplex.com/SHFB (You will need version 1.7.0.0 or newer)
   Microsoft HTML Help: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=14188 (Not required for Vista)
   .NET 3.5 SP1 http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ab99342f-5d1a-413d-8319-81da479ab0d7&DisplayLang=en


2) We use prebuild to configure and build this project, see the readme.txt in the projects root directory for 
   more information. To build with docs: from the project root directory run: "runprebuild.bat msbuild docs" followed
   by compile.bat, this will generate the necessary xml documentation and assemblies, then create the html project documentation


Additionally if you have 7-Zip installed in the path, a zip archive will be created in the documentation tree
containing all the documentation in a compressed format see: http://www.7-zip.org/
