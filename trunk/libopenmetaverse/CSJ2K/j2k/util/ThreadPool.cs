	/// <summary> This class implements a thread pool. The thread pool contains a set of
	/// threads which can be given work to do.
	/// 
	/// <P>If the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) uses native threads, then the
	/// different threads will be able to execute in different processors in
	/// parallel on multiprocessors machines. However, under some JVMs and
	/// operating systems using native threads is not sufficient to allow the JVM
	/// access to multiple processors. This is the case when native threads are
	/// implemented using POSIX threads on lightweight processes
	/// (i.e. PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS sopce scheduling), which is the case on most
	/// UNIX operating systems. In order to do provide access to multiple
	/// processors it is necessary to set the concurrency level to the number of
	/// processors or slightly higher. This can be achieved by setting the Java
	/// system property with the name defined by CONCURRENCY_PROP_NAME to some
	/// non-negative number. This will make use of the 'NativeServices' class and
	/// supporting native libraries. See 'NativeServices' for details. See
	/// 'CONCURRENCY_PROP_NAME' for the name of the property.
	/// 
	/// <P>Initially the thread pool contains a user specified number of idle
	/// threads. Idle threads can be given a target which is run. While running the
	/// target the thread temporarily leaves the idle list. When the target
	/// finishes, it joins the idle list again, waiting for a new target. When a
	/// target is finished a thread can be notified on a particular object that is
	/// given as a lock.
	/// 
	/// <P>Jobs can be submitted using Runnable interfaces, using the 'runTarget()'
	/// methods. When the job is submitted, an idle thread will be obtained, the
	/// 'run()' method of the 'Runnable' interface will be executed and when it
	/// completes the thread will be returned to the idle list. In general the
	/// 'run()' method should complete in a rather short time, so that the threds
	/// of the pool are not starved.
	/// 
	/// <P>If using the non-asynchronous calls to 'runTarget()', it is important
	/// that any target's 'run()' method, or any method called from it, does not
	/// use non-asynchronous calls to 'runTarget()' on the same thread pool where
	/// it was started. Otherwise this could create a dead-lock when there are not
	/// enough idle threads.
	/// 
	/// <P>The pool also has a global error and runtime exception condition (one
	/// for 'Error' and one for 'RuntimeException'). If a target's 'run()' method
	/// throws an 'Error' or 'RuntimeException' the corresponding exception
	/// condition is set and the exception object saved. In any subsequent call to
	/// 'checkTargetErrors()' the saved exception object is thrown. Likewise, if a
	/// target's 'run()' method throws any other subclass of 'Throwable' a new
	/// 'RuntimeException' is created and saved. It will be thrown on a subsequent
	/// call to 'checkTargetErrors()'. If more than one exception occurs between
	/// calls to 'checkTargetErrors()' only the last one is saved. Any 'Error'
	/// condition has precedence on all 'RuntimeException' conditions. The threads
	/// in the pool are unaffected by any exceptions thrown by targets.
	/// 
	/// <P>The only exception to the above is the 'ThreadDeath' exception. If a
	/// target's 'run()' method throws the 'ThreadDeath' exception a warning
	/// message is printed and the exception is propagated, which will terminate
	/// the thread in which it occurs. This could lead to instabilities of the
	/// pool. The 'ThreadDeath' exception should never be thrown by the program. It 
	/// is thrown by the Java(TM) Virtual Machine when Thread.stop() is
	/// called. This method is deprecated and should never be called.
	/// 
	/// <P>All the threads in the pool are "daemon" threads and will automatically
	/// terminate when no daemon threads are running.
