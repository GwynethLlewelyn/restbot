	/// <summary> This class manages common facilities for multi-threaded
	/// environments, It can register different facilities for each thread,
	/// and also a default one, so that they can be referred by static
	/// methods, while possibly having different ones for different
	/// threads. Also a default facility exists that is used for threads
	/// for which no particular facility has been registerd registered.
	/// 
	/// <p>Currently the only kind of facilities managed is MsgLogger.</p>
	/// 
	/// <P>An example use of this class is if 2 instances of a decoder are running
	/// in different threads and the messages of the 2 instances should be
	/// separated.
	/// 
	/// <P>The default MsgLogger is a StreamMsgLogger that uses System.out as
	/// the 'out' stream and System.err as the 'err' stream, and a line width of
	/// 78. This can be changed using the registerMsgLogger() method.
