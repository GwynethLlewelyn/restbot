RESTbot (where “REST” stands for Representational State Transfer), allows popular web languages to work through Second Life. RESTbots appear as “unmanned” avatars in Second Life, and use XML to act as an intermediary between the world wide web and the metaverse.

This software was originally developed by Pleiades (http://pleiades.ca/) in 2007.

This current version is compatible with libopenmetaverse 0.8.1 since June 4, 2010.
