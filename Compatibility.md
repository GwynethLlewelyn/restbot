Mono is fickle. Compile the same code under different versions or operating systems, and it will simply give all sorts of weird compilation errors. This is an attempt to list valid combinations that actually work.

  * Mac OS X 10.5.8 (Leopard) with Mono 2.4
  * CentOS 5.2 64bits with Mono 2.6.4
  * CentOS 5.2 64bits with Mono 2.6.1
  * CentOS 4.3 32bits with Mono 2.4

Tested but without a successful compilation:

  * CentOS 5.2 64bits with Mono 2.4
